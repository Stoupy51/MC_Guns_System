This value is updated when firing and reloading the weapon. """
RELOAD_TIME: str = "reload_time"
""" Time required to reload the weapon, measured in game ticks. """
RELOAD_END: str = "reload_end"
""" Additional time in ticks after the reload animation completes.
Used to create a smoother transition between reloading and being able to fire again. """
RELOAD_MID: str = "reload_mid"
""" Time in ticks at which the reload sound effect is triggered during the reload sequence.
This parameter is optional and primarily used for weapons with longer reload animations. """
COOLDOWN: str = "cooldown"
""" Delay between consecutive shots, measured in game ticks.
Controls the weapon's rate of fire. Lower values result in faster firing rates. """
BURST: str = "burst"
""" Number of rounds automatically fired when in burst fire mode.
A value of 1 indicates semi-automatic, while 3 would be a three-round burst. """
DAMAGE: str = "damage"
""" Base damage inflicted by each bullet at close range.
This value may be reduced at longer distances based on the decay parameter. """

For instance, a value of 0.95 means damage decreases to 59.9% damage at 10 blocks distance. """

Lower values indicate better accuracy (smaller spread of bullets). """

Typically improves accuracy (reduces spread) when value is lower than base accuracy. """

Higher values result in decreased accuracy (wider bullet spread). """

""" Accuracy penalty applied when the player is sprinting.
Significantly increases bullet spread, making the weapon less accurate. """
ACCURACY_JUMP: str = "acc_jump"
""" Accuracy penalty applied when the player is jumping or in mid-air.
Creates the largest reduction in accuracy, simulating the difficulty of shooting while airborne. """
SWITCH: str = "switch"
""" Time required to switch to this weapon, measured in game ticks.
Controls how quickly the player can change weapons in combat. """
KICK: str = "kick"
""" Intensity of the weapon's recoil effect.
Higher values create stronger visual kick when firing. """

""" Type of bullet casing ejected when firing.
Determines the visual model and properties of the ejected casing. """
CASING_OFFSET: str = "casing_offset"
""" Relative position to the player to use when summoning the casing.
The value is modified in setup_database.py according to the zoom type. """

Controls the upward force applied to the casing during ejection. """

Determines how far the casing is pushed forward or backward, with added randomness for realism. """

Controls the horizontal offset of the casing, contributing to its full 3D trajectory. """

Determines which weapon model and animations to use as a foundation.
Used for weapons that share the same base model but have different stats or attachments. """

Available types: tiny, small, medium, large, largest, rocket. """
