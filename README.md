# TODO:
- Create ammunition system with reloadable items
- Implement Reload Mid, Cooldown Mid, Cooldown End, etc.
- Reorganize weapon NBT structure to move sounds under "all.sounds" instead of "all.stats" I made
- For weapons without cooldown (e.g. pistol), implement single-click behavior to prevent holding right-click
- Implement RPG impact explosion mechanics
- Add burst fire mode functionality
- Trigger reload when weapon is dropped, or switched to off-hand?
- Implement a title action bar that shows bullet icons (grayed = no bullet) instead of count/max_count
